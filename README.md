AntiVPN is a powerful plugin for BungeeCord servers designed to protect your network by preventing players from joining via VPNs, proxies, Tor, or relay networks. It utilizes the VPNAPI.io service to detect masked IP addresses in real-time and automatically disconnects suspicious players.

### Features:
- **Real-Time Detection:** Blocks players using VPNs, proxies, Tor, or relay networks.
- **Automatic Disconnects:** Players attempting to join with unauthorized IPs are kicked with a customizable message.
- **Staff Alerts:** Notifies staff members with the permission `antivpn.alert` when a player is blocked, showing their username and IP address.
- **Easy Configuration:** Customize alert messages and staff permissions in the `config.yml` file.

This plugin is perfect for server administrators who want to secure their server against anonymous or malicious users, ensuring a fair and safe gaming experience.
